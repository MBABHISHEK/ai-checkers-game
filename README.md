# AI Minimax Checkers

This project is a simple **Checkers** game where one player is human, and the other is controlled by an AI using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI opponent makes moves based on a search tree, considering all possible moves, and picks the best one.

## Features:
- **Human vs AI Mode**: Play against an AI that uses the **Minimax algorithm** to determine the best moves.
- **AI Difficulty**: The AI's search depth is set to 3, but you can change this to increase/decrease difficulty.
- **Win Condition**: The game ends when one player wins, and a message is displayed showing the winner.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The game is displayed on a window using the Pygame library, where the user can click to make their move.

## Requirements

To run the game, you will need:
- **Python 3.x** (recommended version: 3.7 or higher)
- **Pygame library** for creating the GUI.

You can install the required libraries by running the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
